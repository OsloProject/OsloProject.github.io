      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      Why? Perhabs this is the question that brought you here. During a
      car trip back home from a hackathon we discussed that using
      Google Maps works great for navigating because it has by far
      the best traffic jam detection that I ever used. However we
      also found it kinda scarry to send a large global company
      like google all of our personal data, especially our location
      and our destinations. We continued this thought and came to
      a point where we realized that modern phonse are basically
      bugging devices that we carry around. And no matter what
      app you using the operating system will likely be developed
      by a huge cooperation like Microsoft, Apple or Google.<br>
      We thought that there needs to be a way to create an alternative
      operating system with a focus on privacy. The only way to truly
      achive this is to make <b>everything</b> open-source. So we cannot
      hide anything in our sources. This was the point where we decided
      to start the Oslo Project to create a linux based, open-source
      operating system for smartphones.<br>
      However this is a far to huge problem for one or even three people
      to solve. We hope to build a large community around the project so
      that many people can develop, test and even audit the system.<br>
      So lets make this dream come true and ban cooperations from stealing
      our most valuable data and from spying on us with our own devices.
      If you are convinced please feel free to join us!
