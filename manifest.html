      <h2>Manifest</h2>
      Our Manifest consists of two parts, the first is a set of
      rules that are enforced for everything in the project. We
      will not allow any contributions which do not follow this
      rules. But dont worry, we are not evil and if you think
      a rule is just stupid, talk with us and we can discuss
      it! The idea behind this is that we do not need to
      discuss this type of things during every pull-request
      but instead have everything listed here.<br>
      The second Part consists of rules which are accepted but
      not yet enforced. This means, that new contributions
      have to follow them, but some of the older stuff does
      not follow it (yet). The long term goal is to move
      these rules to the first part.

      <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
      <ol type="I">
        <li>All code needs to be open-source. We will not accept code
        which is or depends on code which is not open-source.</li>
        <li>Privacy and the protection of the users data is the primary goal.</li>
        <li>Only collect as much data as required.</li>
        <li>Give the users as many choices as possible while still keeping
        everything simple.</li>
        <li>If you distribute a modified version of Oslo, please make it
        clear to the users.</li>

        <br>more soon...
      </ol>
